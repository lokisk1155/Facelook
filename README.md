# [Facelook (live link)](https://faceooook.herokuapp.com/)
Welcome to Facelook, my full-stack clone of Facebook, started during my time at App Academy. This project encapsulates the first year of my journey in software development, showcasing both my growth and the challenges I faced. While it may have its imperfections, the experience gained in development, refactoring, and debugging has been pivotal in my evolution as a software engineer. A standout feature of this project is the dynamic User Text Stories. I innovated a method to save both text and inline CSS styles, enabling the recreation of unique user-generated content. This feature, though not groundbreaking, marked a significant milestone in my journey, giving me a profound sense of accomplishment as an engineer

## üíª Stack

### React 
React has transformed UI development with its component-based architecture, streamlining the management of state and props to craft dynamic and responsive interfaces. It unified the aspects of frontend development for me, offering a sense of cohesion that was less apparent in other frameworks. Ruby on Rails shares parallels, especially with its controllers akin to the supportive role of JavaScript for the view or JSX. However, the ability to manipulate both state and presentation directly on the frontend, a shift from my experience with Ruby on Rails, felt empowering, almost like acquiring a new superpower in web development, a JS superpower that was for sure abused 

### Redux
Integrating Redux into my project was a pivotal learning experience, particularly with the introduction of the Redux logger middleware. This tool provided invaluable insights into the state changes and rerenders within my application, allowing me to understand and optimize the rendering process at a much deeper level. By visually tracking each action and the resulting state transition, I gained a clearer comprehension of how data flows and triggers updates in the application, significantly enhancing my debugging and development skills

### PostgreSQL 
PostgreSQL is a robust, SQL-compliant database system, renowned for its advanced features, data integrity, and support for complex queries. It's highly scalable and extensible, making it ideal for handling diverse data types and large-scale, high-performance applications.

### AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) proved crucial in my project, especially through the use of S3 for robust, scalable cloud storage and IAM for secure access management, enabling efficient and secure image uploads. This integration highlights AWS's versatility and capacity to enhance web applications, ranging from straightforward hosting to complex, data-driven functionalities
